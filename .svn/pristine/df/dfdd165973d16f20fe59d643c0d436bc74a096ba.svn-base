# Shogun-JVM #

## Introduction ##
Shogun (http://shogun.ml/) is a unified and efficient machine learning library which has been implemented in C++ and supports
many languages (Python, Octave, R, Java/Scala, Lua, C#, Ruby, etc) 

Python is the most supported language if you want to implement some Machine Learning. It is much harder to find some good frameworks if you want
to implement Machine Learning in a JVM based environment. Therefore Shogun is am interesting framework because it also supports Java but it is hard to use
because it is not available in Maven.  

## Goal ##

The goal of Shogun-JVM is to make Shogun accessible directly from a Maven Repository so that it does not need to be installed separately before it can be used,  
so that we get the same level of comfort that we currently have on the Python side with Anaconda and pip.  

## Supported System Environments ##

Currently we only support the following system environments:
- shogun6.1.3-linux-x86_64
- shogun6.1.3-osx-x86_64

Please let me know if you need any additional platform.

## Implementation Details ##

- The shogin.jar is available in the Maven Repository
- Shogun-JVM provides a POM which refers to all dependencies 
- The compiled c++ libraries are stored as resources in the shogun-jvm JAR
- We provide a simple layer which loads the c++ libraries using com.github.fommil.JNILoader


## Versions ##
All the jars are available for JDK 1.8 and higher 
We provide the latest released Shogun version which currently is 6.1.3
 

## Documentation ##

We provide the following examples which demonstrate how Shogun(-JVM) can be used with different JVM based languages using BeakerX
- Scala
- Java
- Groovie
- Kotlin
- Clojure

The documentation for Shogun can be found at http://shogun.ml/api/latest/classes.html

## Alternative Usage ##
The basic intension of this project was to provide the compiled c++ artifacts. You can however just use the jars from Maven and use
the mechanism provided by Shogun to load the binaries by specifying the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (MacOS)
