# Shogun-JVM #

## Introduction ##
Shogun (http://shogun.ml/) is a unified and efficient machine learning library which has been implemented in C++ and supports
many languages (Python, Octave, R, Java/Scala, Lua, C#, Ruby, etc) 

Python is the most supported language if you want to implement some Machine Learning. It is much harder to find some good frameworks if you want
to implement Machine Learning in a JVM based environment. Therefore Shogun is am interesting framework because it also supports Java but it is hard to use
because it is not available in Maven.  

Unfortunatly it is very hard to install the libraries which are needed for java. 

## Goal ##

The goal of Shogun-JVM is 
- to make the relevant binaries available via Anaconda 
- to provide all Java dependencies via the Maven Repository


## Supported System Environments ##

Currently we only support the following system environments:
- osx
- linux


## Implementation Details ##

- The shogin.jar is made available in the Maven Repository
- Shogun-JVM provides a POM which refers to all dependencies 
- We provide a simple java layer which loads the c++ jndi libraries so that it is not necessary to
  set any additonal environmant variables (LD_LIBRARY_PATH, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, java.library.path)


## Versions ##
All the jars are available for JDK 1.8 and higher 
We provide the latest released Shogun version which currently is 6.1.3
 

## Documentation ##

We provide the following examples which demonstrate how Shogun(-JVM) can be used with different JVM based languages using BeakerX
- Scala
- Java
- Groovie
- Kotlin
- Clojure

The documentation for Shogun can be found at http://shogun.ml/api/latest/classes.html

## Installation Instruction ##

You can use conda to install the binaries:
	
	conda install shogun-jvm

Alternatively you can also use Homebrew in OSX or LinuxBrew in linux:
	
	brew install shogun  

In maven you can define

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.shogun</groupId>
		<artifactId>shogun-jvm</artifactId>
		<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>
